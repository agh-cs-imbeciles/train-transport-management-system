## Instructions how to run
1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git@github.com:agh-cs-imbeciles/train-transport-management-system.git
    ```
2. Go the _backend_ directory
    ```
    cd backend
    ```
3. Install node packages
    ```
    npm install
    npm install --save-dev
    ```
4. Run development server
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```


## Database
The database is document-oriented, runned on `MongoDB`, more precisely [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).

### Collections
Contains __X__ collections.

#### Users collection
Defines users of the application, clients and staff but without checking their roles.
